 Energy Demand Forecasting Project

 Overview
This project focuses on forecasting energy demand in the United States using various statistical and machine learning methods. The primary objective is to analyze nuclear energy consumption trends and forecast future demand using Exponential Smoothing, ARIMA, XGBoost, and Random Forest models.

 Data Description

 Main Dataset
- File: use_all_btu.csv
- Rows: 14,773
- Columns: 66
- Features:
  - Data_Status: Status of the data (e.g., Final, Preliminary).
  - State: U.S. state codes.
  - MSN: Energy type or activity codes.
  - 1960 - 2022: Yearly energy consumption in Billion BTU.

 MSN Descriptions
- File: msn_codes_and_descriptions.xlsx
- Sheets:
  - MSN descriptions: Provides descriptions and units for MSN codes.

 Steps and Methodology

 1. Data Preprocessing
- Loaded and explored the raw dataset.
- Handled missing values, especially in early years (1960–1969).
- Merged use_all_btu.csv with MSN descriptions for better interpretability.
- Converted data to a long format using pd.melt for time-series analysis.

 2. Nuclear Energy Focus
- Filtered data to focus on nuclear energy (MSN code: NUEGB).
- Conducted state-wise and national-level analysis.
- Plotted trends for top states and the national total.

 3. Forecasting Approaches
 Exponential Smoothing
- Applied to national nuclear consumption data.
- Forecasted the next 5 years.
- Metrics: 
  - MAE: Mean Absolute Error
  - RMSE: Root Mean Squared Error

 Auto ARIMA
- Automatically selected ARIMA parameters.
- Compared forecasts with actual data.
- Provided model summaries for transparency.

 Machine Learning Models
- Created lagged features for supervised learning.
- Models Used:
  - XGBoost Regressor
  - Random Forest Regressor
- Evaluated using:
  - MAE
  - RMSE
  - MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)

 Results

| Model                 | MAE                | RMSE               | MAPE (%) |
|--|--|--|-|
| XGBoost               | 24431.3625         | 28839.491318451357 | 4.86%    |
| Random Forest         | 15493.059999999998 | 18636.512080368473 | 5.42%    |
